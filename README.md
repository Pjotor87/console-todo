<p align="center">Do you have dreams??</p>

<p align="center">I know I do.</p>

<p align="center">That is why this LIGHTWEIGHT todo application was made.</p>

<p align="center">Based on REVOLUTIONARY console "looping" technology!</p>

<p align="center">You heard right. It runs IN THE CONSOLE!</p>

<p align="center">Big data clusters? Maybe.</p>

<p align="center">Internet of things? If you want. Why not?</p>

<p align="center">QUESTION!</p>

<p align="center">Have you ever been at the office. And Lisa from the cubicle next to yours comes by for a thing and glances over at your screen. She sees your bland black and white todo list and thinks to herself, "Oh no! This guy is not marriage material at all!"</p>

<p align="center">Well let me first tell you this.</p>

<p align="center">YOU ARE NOT ALONE!</p>

<p align="center">That is why so much heart and effort went into the creation of the new "Multicolored menus" feature.</p>

<p align="center">Allow me to explain.</p>

<p align="center">△ THIS IS NOT A PYRAMID SCHEME! △</p>

<p align="center">Six carefully handpicked colors are "output" to the console to bring delight to our eyes.</p>

<p align="center">Next time Lisa takes a look at your screen and sees this work of art running well... I don't want to promise too much, but... I myself am happily married for 93 years now and still going strong. Let's just leave it at that ;) Wink!</p>

# To run
It's a .net core console app so just open the solution file with VS.
