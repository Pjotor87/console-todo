# console-todo
It's a LIGHTWEIGHT todo application based on REVOLUTIONARY console "looping" technology.

You heard right. It runs IN THE CONSOLE!

Big data clusters? Maybe.

Internet of things? If you want. Why not?

QUESTION!

Have you ever been at the office. And Lisa from the cubicle next to yours comes by for a thing and glances over at your screen. She sees your bland black and white todo list and thinks to herself, "Oh no! This guy is not marriage material at all!"

Well let me first tell you this.

YOU ARE NOT ALONE!

That is why so much heart and effort went into the creation of the new "Multicolored menus" feature.

Allow me to explain.

THIS IS NOT A PYRAMID SCHEME!

Six carefully handpicked colors are "output" to the console to bring delight to our eyes.

Next time Lisa takes a look at your screen and sees this work of art running well... I don't want to promise too much, but... I myself am happily married for 93 years now and still going strong. Let's just leave it at that ;) Wink!

# To run
It's a .net core console app so just open the solution file with VS.

Pass a single argument to it -> The path of a .txt file used as the database.

If a file doesn't exist at the path passed, a .txt file will be created.
